Voronoi Tactics:
Decals seem to have huge effect on improving the map look for Field of Glory, this is likely the case for this too

Deployment options (entrenching/barricades)
Different battle modes (skirmish - just fight) (attack - time limit to attacker reach province)
Units have facing direction(whats default?)(no default and assigned on movement)
Take penalties to have more deployment points (low morale) (low supplies) (not taking winter gear when needed)
Draw on map to plan
Assign Color to units on deployment
Different type of river connections(brook, river,etc)
Day/Night cycle with different modifiers (temperature, visibility, etc) that change with time. The values they take are based on climate setting
Another phase of gameplay where the 2 armies move around trying to gain a terrain advantage prior to the battle?
Units have a distance of visibility(in provinces) and may take time to identify unit
Battle captains in some units to improve local moral (like Fields of Glory 2) (Chance of dying in combat, will reduce moral around it)
Civilization level on biome indicating presence of roads, buildings, farms, etc (perhaps something more direct is better, specify number of roads/river bridges/farms/buildings)
Continuous battle result showing % losses, % cost lost, etc
Retreats impact neighbor units morale
Can retreat many tiles away without control
Basic prediction of combat between 2 units
Fatigue
Minimap
Hidden Map Option in Battle Setup
Stacking is allowed but huge penalties to combat, only used to position units, cant use ranged attack too
Low Organization in hard terrain but high defense. So, hard to attack from hard terrain
Small panel with ambient conditions(weather, sun position, time, wind, ground condition)
Chemical attack on provinces
Province on Fire and spread
Battle decals (bodies, artilery craters)
In campaign battles/historical battles full date is nice immersion thing
Territory Pride (Spend some deployment points to give all units a boost to max morale (20%), symbolizes fighting for their country)
Some stat for units that modifies negative impacts of terrain(movement,attack,defense)
Some stat for units that modifies negative impact of weather
Acclimatization (Spend some deployment points to reduce weather effects on units)
Terrain have different attack/defense modifiers for ranged, melee and charge
Some modifier applied if unit is getting combat from multiple directions (modifier to morale)
