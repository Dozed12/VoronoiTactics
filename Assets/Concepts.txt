Theme:

Napoleonic era battles with elements of steampunk/dieselpunk and ww1 technology
Very limited armor and tanks (single units)
Chemical Attacks

Battles:

Full on decisive battles after a long time of preparation and manuvering to decide the battleground

Combat Situations:

- 2 units in neighbour tiles.
+ A starts ranged attack on B
+ B starts ranged attack on A
+ Combat ends when one of them retreats/surrenders

- 2 units in neighbour tiles.
+ A starts ranged attack on B
+ B starts ranged attack on A
+ A starts melee attack on B (Takes half the time it would take to move to tile of B before it can start melee)
+ A applies charge attack on B once (Only if A has charge attack)
+ Melee combat between both start
+ Combat ends when one of them retreats/surrenders

- 2 units in neighbour tiles.
+ A starts ranged attack on B
+ B starts ranged attack on A
+ A starts melee attack on B (Takes half the time it would take to move to tile of B before it can start melee)
+ A applies charge attack on B once (Only if A has charge attack)
+ Melee combat between both start
+ B decides to pull back and retreat to another tile
+ A occupies tile of B
+ A continues to apply melee combat to B until B is halfway into retreat tile

- 2 units in neighbour tiles.
+ A starts ranged attack on B
+ B starts ranged attack on A
+ A starts melee attack on B (Takes half the time it would take to move to tile of B before it can start melee)
+ B starts melee attack on A (Takes half the time it would take to move to tile of B before it can start melee)
+ A applies charge attack on B once (Only if A has charge attack)
+ B applies charge attack on A once (Only if A has charge attack)
(Both charges only apply if both prepare the melee attack before the other charge hits)
(Once a charge hits, the other will hit too even if still not arrived at "half the time...")
+ Melee combat between both start
+ B decides to pull back and retreat to another tile
+ A occupies tile of B
+ A continues to apply melee combat to B until B is halfway into retreat tile

- 2 units in neighbour tiles.
+ A starts ranged attack on B
+ B starts ranged attack on A
+ A starts melee attack on B (Takes half the time it would take to move to tile of B before it can start melee)
+ B decides to retreat to another tile before A arrives
+ If B retreats fast enough then no combat occurs.
+ If B is not fast enough then combat occurs but B keeps retreating, and like previously, once halfway to retreat tile it is safe

- 2 units in neighbour tiles.
+ A starts ranged attack on B
+ B starts ranged attack on A
+ A starts melee attack on B (Takes half the time it would take to move to tile of B before it can start melee)
+ B decides to retreat to another tile before A arrives
+ B is not fast enough and combat occurs until B finishes half the retreat
+ B decides to stay and fight in melee cancelling the retreat (Retreat can only be cancelled if less than half was completed)

Many concepts:

* If Surrounded by enemies and retreats then it shatters and is captured.

* A man lost is 1 morale point lost

* Max Morale = Current Men ^ 2 / Max Men + Max Men (Inverse Quadratic) (Could express it as percentage)

* Units have Minimum Morale (%), if below that value unit retreats, if Current Max Morale > Max Morale * Minimum Morale unit shatters and retreats until leaving the map
At < Minimum Morale morale a unit retreats to a random vacant or ally(priority to vacant) neighbour. (no stacking penalty if occupied tile but even bigger morale hit from seeing ally retreat)
Weather and Condition minimum morale modifiers are only applied when taking casualties so unit wont retreat randomly while reloading

* Weather can affect max morale (some % modifier)
Can be negated by Acclimatization set to entire army, at expense of some Deployment Points

* Seeing a neighbor retreat reduces morale by some % of max morale

* Condition always recharging to 0% at a base rate, modified by Weight.
Condition Recover = Base Cost * (1 - (Weight - 1))

* Condition from reloading/marching/running has a base value also modified by Weight.
Condition Cost = Base Cost * (1 - (Weight - 1))

* Some estimate of base values relation for condition
    - Recovery: 0.001
    - Reload: 0.0015 (Higher than Recovery but not too much)
    - March: 0.002 (About double of Recovery)
    - Run: 0.005 (More than double of March)
    - Melee: 0.003 (Slightly higher than marching)

* Condition has an impact on all actions. Starts at 100% and decreases with every action by a base amount modified by Weight.
At 0% it reduces/increases things by 25%.
4% condition lost -> 1% reduction/increase in actions
Reduces attack values, attack accuracy, speed, melee defense
Increases reload time and minimum morale

* Armor stat indicating how many hits unit needs to be destroyed(To be hit needs to be hit by unit with HardAttack flag, like artillery)
Basically have single or low number of tanks in a unit
Artillery, with HardAttack flag, can bombard these tanks and maybe pennetrate
After N hits a tank is lost
(This implies we can no longer call it "men" but instead something else)
This way we can also have anti-tank guns.
Concept is that an anti-tank regiment needs quite a lot of men and guns to pennetrate a tank(tanks are very heavy, need many hits)
(How do we keep track which tank was hit? Probably just merge all hits in a tank at a time)
(Multi hits dont apply when target has Armor > 0 , "rangedTargets" stat)

* Units with Armor (Original value, just because it lost some armor doesnt mean it can engage in melee) stat greater than 0 can't engage or be engaged in melee(makes no sense to do so)

* Charge attack replaces first melee attack for units with charge

* Ranged/Melee/Charge attacks have a modifier for morale impact (chargeMoraleImpact 1.2 means 20% more morale damage)

* Units have a value indicating their morale defense, reducing all morale damage (Professionalism or Coesion or Organization, something like that)

* Units getting attacked from multiple directions take a flanking penalty to morale.
(Each extra enemy adds 20% morale damage to everything)
(Each extra enemy reduces defender melee/ranged/charge defense by 20%) (Reducing ranged defense doesn't make much sense)
Only first unit occupies the defender tile when combat finishes with win

* Terrain Height difference impacts a series of specific combat parts based on point difference:
    - Charge attack is reduced by 25% per height difference (Hard to do an efficient charge up hill)
    - Melee attack against higher position is reduced by 20% per height difference
    - Melee attack against lower position is increased by 20% per height difference
    - Ranged accuracy against higher position is decreased by 10% per height difference
    - Ranged accuracy against lower position is increased by 10% per height difference
    - Melee fatigue against higher position is increased by 20% per height difference
    - Melee fatigue against lower position is decreased by 20% per height difference

* Terrain Height difference impacts movement too.
    - Movement fatigue from moving to higher position is increased by 20% per height difference
    - Movement fatigue from moving to lower position is decreased by 20% per height difference
    - Movement speed in moving to higher position is decreased by 20% per height difference
    - Movement speed in moving to lower position is increased by 20% per height difference

* Units have different stealth and spotting capabilities
    - Typical Units have base 5 spotting and 1 stealth. (Scouts probably have more spotting and some special units more stealth)
    - Visibility is calculated as a bresenham line(plenty of ways to optimize) from center to center.
    - Terrain types can affect spotting distance.
    - Typical terrain like grassland has Blocking 1 which reduces spotting by 1.
    - Forest has Blocking 3 for example
    - High terrain should boost Spotting (HOW?) (maybe just flat increase on spotting) (calculate average height of map and give bonus equal to height difference to average, not very realistic) (alternatively a higher height reduces spot cost for provinces in lower height)
    - Terrain height can block sight (need to detect saliences, if a unit at height 1 and can see height 2 it wont be able to see a height 1 behind it but still see height 2 fine(or not if we consider the angle doesnt allow it))
    - Stealth indicates how much Spotting is needed to spot the unit. (For example a unit with 5 spotting can't spot a unit 3 tiles away if it has 2 stealth)

* Terrain Type has many effects on combat and can deeply affect its result (TODO expand on this)
Each terrain has cover(increases ranged defense always and melee defense if defending)

* Connection between provinces can have many effects (TODO expand on this)
    - Fortifications exist in a tile facing a specific tile. So they only benefict one of the tiles.
    - Fortifications give cover value like terrain type.
    - Fortifications can be built in deployment phase by some special units, to a limited level
    - Rivers between tiles affect movement speed and reduce melee attack and defense of attacker (defender will be at the exit of river ready to attack)
    - Different type of water streams have different impact and some may be impassable. (Brooke, Creek, River)
    - Big height differences may form impassible terrain like cliffs(height 1 to height 3) (Biome file should specify this, incluing name, height difference it happens and decals)
