+ A applies charge attack on B once (Only if A has charge attack)
+ Melee combat between both start

- 2 units in neighbour tiles.
+ A starts ranged attack on B
+ B starts ranged attack on A
+ A starts melee attack on B (Takes half the time it would take to move to tile of B before it can start melee)

+ Melee combat between both start
+ B decides to pull back and retreat to another tile
+ A occupies tile of B
+ A continues to apply melee combat to B until B is halfway into retreat tile

+ A starts ranged attack on B
+ B starts ranged attack on A
+ A starts melee attack on B (Takes half the time it would take to move to tile of B before it can start melee)
+ B decides to retreat to another tile before A arrives
+ If B retreats fast enough then no combat occurs.
+ If B is not fast enough then combat occurs but B keeps retreating, and like previously, once halfway to retreat tile it is safe

* At <0 morale a unit retreats to a random vacant or ally(priority to vacant) neighbour. (What happens if it retreats to ally province? Applies the stacking penalties?)
* If Surrounded by enemies and retreats then it shatters and is captured.
* Current Max Morale = Current Number * Max Number / Max Morale
* Morale Lost = Number Lost(at an instance) * Max Morale / Max Number
* Morale lost is based on original max morale and max number meaning that losing a soldier has always the same impact. However, since max morale decreases with less numbers,
a unit will retreat more easily
* Weather can affect max morale (some % modifier)
* Seeing a neighbor retreat reduces morale by some % of max morale
* Fatigue has an impact on all actions. Starts at 0% and increases with every action by a base amount modified by Fatigue Modifier.
At 100% it reduces/increases things by 50%.
2% fatigue -> 1% reduction/increase
Reduces attack values, attack accuracy, speed, melee defense
Increases reload time and melee time
